Title: Predictive Modeling for Specialist Treatment Need in Students

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to assess, whether students may require specialist treatment.


Dataset:
The dataset utilized in this project comprises student information including,

timestamp, gender, age, course, current year of study, CGPA, 
marital status, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks.

Data Preprocessing:
use libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for cleaning and organizing the data. 

Data Visualization:
Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries are used for data visualization.


Machine Learning Algorithm:
The chosen machine learning algorithm for this predictive model is Gaussian Naive Bayes. 

Training and Testing:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train-test split method. 


Accuracy Metrics:
Accuracy_score and Confusion Matrix are employed as the accuracy check metrics. 

Model Saving and Deployment:
Upon successful training, the Gaussian Naive Bayes model is saved for future use of prediction of new incoming data. 

conclusion: This project demonstrates a systematic approach to predicting the need for specialist treatment in students using a machine learning algorithm.
